	<p><strong>Dear Internet &ndash; I was inspired today.</strong></p>
<p>I bought this website several months ago and it has since sat dormant, blighted, and unloved. Today, I will change that. Today, I build and share with the world. Today is the day when digits strike the keys.</p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps I have been <a href="https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Strange_mood">taken by a fell mood</a>. Or maybe I have finally drank the kool-aid being passed around by productivity-focused YouTubers. Regardless of the source, I&rsquo;ve found inspiration. Today, I share my three intents for this public journal:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#PPE">The Pursuit of Personal Enrichment</a></li>
<li><a href="#ARI">The Arbitrage of Resonant Ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="#GTA">The Generation of Technical Art</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-pursuit-of-personal-enrichment-hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">The Pursuit of Personal Enrichment 
<a name="PPE"></a></h2>
<p>Last year, I set out on two separate journeys simultaneously: (1) I enrolled in a grad program for my technical field of study, and (2) I engaged in more content unrelated to my field of study. While pursuing career advancement, I separately applied the academic rigor found in graduate programs to topics and fields that were not in my wheelhouse. <strong>And something amazing happened. I loved it.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/african-american-studies/afam-162">revisited</a> my lacking elementary school education of US History. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8723692-american-colossus">pondered</a> the economics of Gilded Age America. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1217728.Wolf_Totem">flipped through</a> novels popular in China. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13723378-gardner-s-art-through-the-ages">gazed upon</a> the Art History canon. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">followed</a> programming tutorials to generate exciting outputs.</p>
<p>This journal will document this pursuit. I&rsquo;m already doing it. I&rsquo;m already receiving so much joy from it. Not only will the journal serve as an avenue for me to ensure my engagement with the content, but it will also keep me honest and diligent.</p>
<h2 id="the-arbitrage-of-resonant-ideas-hahahugoshortcode-s1-hbhb">The Arbitrage of Resonant Ideas 
<a name="ARI"></a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed how I consume products of the Internet. Previously, I would idly tune into a 3 hour YouTube video while playing videogames. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with this as a pass-time. However, I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t remotely remember what happened in the hours and days of videos I was &ldquo;watching&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So now I focus on <strong>consumption with intent</strong>. Autoplay is disabled on all platforms. I choose exactly what information I want to hear and what content I want to consume.</p>
<p>But further than that, I want to ensure I&rsquo;m engaging and sharing the most resonant concepts found in this content. This journal will help spread these resonant ideas. If I find some topic in a podcast to be particularly relatable, it&rsquo;s likely that other readers will also derive some sort of benefit, too. This is certainly nothing new, and I must credit <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/using-notion-as-a-resonance-calendar/">Ali Abdaal</a> with this concept.</p>
<h2 id="the-generation-of-technical-art-hahahugoshortcode-s2-hbhb">The Generation of Technical Art 
<a name="GTA"></a></h2>
<p>Lastly, I want some eye candy. I&rsquo;ve been toying around with creative programming over the last few months and, after some initial hurdles, I&rsquo;ve generated some pretty cool images. Right now, I&rsquo;m creating scripts in p5js following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk">&ldquo;Generative Art Speedrun&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Expressing creativity is hugely important to me. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to be creative while packing the rest of my day with more engaging ventures. However, I&rsquo;ve often thought of creativity as a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/fourhumors.html">fifth humor</a>: creativity must be kept in balance and &ldquo;let out&rdquo; in order to keep the body in equilibrium. Sharing this art will help keep the balance. And maybe make some <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/functionfollows/shop?asc=u">nifty wallpapers, posters, or tshirts</a>.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s where things stand. In leiu of a well-thought-out conclusion, I&rsquo;ve recently been struck by the sense of just hitting &ldquo;Publish&rdquo;. Perhaps this article had some impact: <a href="https://www.xaprb.com/blog/never-done-thus-already-done/">It&rsquo;s Never Done, Thus It&rsquo;s Already Done</a>.</p>
<p><strong>There will be some growing pains as this journal gets off the ground. Pardon the dust.</strong></p>
